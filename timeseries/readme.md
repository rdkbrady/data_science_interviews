# Time Series Data / Pandas

This challenge consists of two datasets "temperature" and "sales". 

Temperature has two columns:
- day (int): the day, starting at 0, on which the temperature was measured
- temperature (float): The temperature in degrees Fahrenheit 

Sales has two columns:
- day (int): the day, starting at 0, on which the sales were made
- sales (float): The dollar value of sales on that day

#### Challenge Questions:

- What are the weekly total sales?
- What time of year are sales highest?
- What time of year are sales lowest?

- When are sales and temperature recorded?
- Can you merge these data?
- Is there a relationship between temperature and sales?
